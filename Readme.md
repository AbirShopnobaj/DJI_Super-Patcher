***Super Patcher For Mavic Pro and Mavic Pro Platinum***

This package is for installing a custom patched 306 flight controller for the Mavic Pro or Mavic Pro Platinum on a Mavic running a 100% stock version of the 01.04.0300 firmware.

This is a Flight Controller Patch for DJI Mavic Pro and Pro Plantinum. It will not work on any other drones!

**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE PROCEEDING**

This is NOT a mixed firmware modification.This will modify the ACTUAL 306 module on Mavics runnig the STOCK 01.04.0300 firmware, therefore, it does not require an internal sd card installed like other modification methods. Percision RTH works normally after this modification(other methods prevent this feature from working properly.)\par This modification is to be done ONLY on a Mavic Pro or Mavic Pro Platinum- that has a STOCK 01.04.0300 firmware installed!

If your current firmware is a mixed with the flight controller from 01.03.0700 DO NOT PROCEED before reflashing a clean stock version of 01.04.0300 using DUMLdore! Flash stock 01.04.0300 twice to be sure the entire firware has fully installed

You can download a stock version of 01.04.0300 if you need one with the DankDownloader tool https://github.com/cs2000/DankDroneDownloader or directly from 
http://dji.polybotes.feralhosting.com/DJI-Firmware/BIN/Mavic%20Pro%20(Incl%20Platinum%20and%20Alpine)/V01.04.0300_Mavic_dji_system.bin

This modification will

Remove height limits from the firmware. 

Turn off aircraft side nfz restrictions. 

Enable Gallileo satellite reception. 

Enable setting yaw speed to as low as 1 degree per second in any mode using Assistant 2 1.1.2 in debug mode or with DJI Go 4 in normal and cinematic mode to get much smoother and slower cinematic pans. I perfer sport at 30 degrees per second, avoid mode at 28 d/s cinematic and tripod mode at 3 d/s

Extends the parameter range that yaw movement limit can be set for normal mode, avoid mode, sport mode, cinematic mode, and tripod mode, in Assistant 1.1.2 by the user.

These modifications are automatic but can be undone by reflashing the original stock firmware 01.04.0300 firmware. Additional modifications can be enabled by the user using Assistant 2 1.1.2 in debug mode. Some parameter ranges have been expanded.

*The purpose of this modification is to allow experienced and law abiding citizens to unlock their Mavic Pro without the need to contact DJI to fly their aircraft.*

**Use at your own risk**

*The pilot in command is always resposible for flight safety and following local regulations. This removes some of the "idiot-proofing" designed into DJI products so take extra care to know your local laws before each flight*

A special thanks to Henfri and lukasx for taking the plunge to test this with their birds before knowing what would happen and their continued contributions throughout development.

Also thanks to D95GAS, frank2006, and Kilrah for consulting.

This project is made possible by the work done by many contributers and dependencies. This project contains alomost no new programming and serves as an easy to use deployment of the /o-gs/DJI_FC_Patcher project https://github.com/o-gs/DJI_FC_Patcher by Matioupi that anyone can use with almost no technical ability.

This project relies on the hard work of jezzab and the jezzab/DUMLdore application https://github.com/jezzab/DUMLdore

Thanks to the OGs who, by making their work open and open source, not only powers this poject but have enabled me to liberate myself from the limits imposed on my property by DJI and inspired me to help others liberate themselves.

There are many whos names I do not know that contributed to the dependencies required for this project. I apologise for not having all of their names acknowleged but I will update this list as I discover them.
